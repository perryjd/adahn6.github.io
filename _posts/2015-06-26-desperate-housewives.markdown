A shocking suicide shoots intrigue into the suburban wet dream of Wisteria Lane. The titular housewives struggle with the betrayal from one of their own, while quietly wrestling with their own demons. Sharp doses of irony amusingly cut through the American dream in the earlier episodes, though wit has long disappeared by the end. However, the later revelations of Mary Alice's final secrets are bathed in a quiet sadness, leaving a bittersweet taste to the season. Like all dreams, Wisteria Lane's stories hurtle with a breathless pace through the absurd, yet are still hard to shake off after waking up.
