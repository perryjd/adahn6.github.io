Dinosaurs come back from the dead, yet are barely the more interesting for it. They roar, they snap, but they rarely frighten, and they never awe. The movie makes a half-hearted commentary on this by loading the park with disillusioned tourists. But in the end, it only proves them right; none of these dinosaurs inspire more than a passing glance. The human side of the conflict is no better -- characters reminsicent of saltine crackers do the requisite routine of fleeing and getting eaten, but nothing more. A movie about a theme park with none of the fun of visiting one.

#### 5/10
