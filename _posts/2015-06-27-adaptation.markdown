A screenwriter cannot adapt the real life book "The Orchid Thief", so he writes a movie about struggling to write the screenplay. The book is unfilmable, he muses, so despite his reservations he inserts cliches and genre trappings. The resulting movie is not a good one, and that is the movie's greatest strength. The original and inventive portion is aimless and boring, and the cliched silliness later is more entertaining in its cheesy way. Genre trappings did not save this film, but they did not doom it; creativity did. A bold counter argument to the usual claims of high art.
