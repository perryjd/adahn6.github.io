A screenwriter cannot adapt the real life book "The Orchid Thief", so he writes a movie about struggling to write the screenplay itself. The book is unfilmable, he muses, so despite his reservations he inserts cliches. The resulting movie is not a good one, and that it's greatest strength. The original and inventive portion is aimless and boring, and the cliched silliness later is more entertaining in a frustrated and cheesy way. Genre trappings did not save this adaptation, but they did not doom it; creativity did. A bold counter argument to the usual smug superiority claims of high art. 
#### 5/10
