A girl struggles with growing up; this is not an original premise for a kids movie. But we see the process through the lens of her anthropomoprhized emotions running her mind behind the scenes, ensuring more nuance than the standard treatment. The core dilemma of the movie is not grandiose, and its statements about life stay safely leashed to everday problems. But explosions and melodrama are easy. The battles here are more mundane than saving the world, but their authenticity bypasses our safeguards, and the lump in our throats tells us maybe this was a movie for adults all along.
